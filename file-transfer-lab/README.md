Running the Program:

Make sure you run the server file first then the client server if you want to
run the program without the proxy. If you want to run the program with the
proxy run the server first, then run the proxy program, and lastly run the
client program like this ./clientProgram -s address:port. After the program is
running there will be a prompt asking for the file that is going to be
transferred. Then it will asks for the remote file name or the name the file
is going to have on the server after it's transferred. The program will then
transfer the file from the client to the server successfully. It will be
unsuccessful when transferring the file if the file already exists on the
server, has a length of zero, or doesn't exist.

To run the program with threads instead of forks go into the thread directory
then file-transfer-lab and run the program the same as you do here.
